# TumblFlee
A hacked together tool to flee tumblr with your images and metadata mostly intact

This code is in no way even slightly production ready - it's a collection of hacks to give you just enough functionality to export your tumblr image posts, captions and tags to a folder, with a little 'viewer' to assist you in copy-pasting to other social media platforms.
I used it to move my personal stuff from Tumblr to Twitter.

## Known Issues:
 - Very little error checking. Good luck.
 - If you've reblogged a post from a tumblr which has since been deleted, or the original post removed, it'll show as an original post for you (because there's no reblog info).
